# Chords üé∂
A small utility library to make Jetbrains/Jetpack Compose more harmonic.

## Setup üõ†
...

## Features ‚≠êÔ∏è
### Dynamic Theme üé®
Supports system dark mode and [Material You Dynamic Color](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/overview) out of the box while allowing for fallback themes used in environments where dynamic color is not supported (such as older Android versions or desktop targets)

*Example*
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent(lightScheme = myLightColorScheme, darkScheme = myDarkColorScheme) {
            DynamicTheme {
                MyComposeView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
